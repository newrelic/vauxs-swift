# Guidelines for contributing code

New Relic welcomes code contributions from the iOS developer community, and
have taken effort to make this process easy for both contributors and our
development team.

When contributing, keep in mind that New Relic retains the right to invoke
editorial discretion. This project is intended to provide helpful example
coding patterns for developers. If we find a contribution to be overwrought,
nonsensicle, or dubious (at our sole discretion) we reserve the right to
reject it.

## And licensing...

You are welcome to send pull requests to us - however, by doing so you agree
that you are granting New Relic a non-exclusive, non-revokable, no-cost license
to use the code, algorithms, patents, and ideas in that code in our products if
we so choose. You also agree the code is provided as-is and you provide no
warranties as to its fitness or correctness for any purpose.
